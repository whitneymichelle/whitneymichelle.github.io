#### History of Lunch and Learns on Our Team

When I first started working with my current data team, we had Lunch and Learns sporadically--where one of us would teach the others something that we knew fairly well, usually related to data analysis or programming or problem-solving. However, for various reasons, we stopped having them, and we were never really consistent with them in the first place.

#### Bringing them Back, Making them Casual

However, a few months into working remotely--something wholly new for our solely in-office team, I proposed that we bring them back and conduct them in a sustainable way for our team. So for the last six months, we have consistently had Lunch and Learns--at a cadence of once a month. 

I will say we already have a lot of collaboration amongst us, with 15-minute check-ins four times a week and an hour weekly staff meeting. But Lunch and Learns have allowed us to make casual space to discuss items parallel to work but not about the specifics of our data projects--which is refreshing. So far, during these get-togethers, we have been able to step back from the details of our work to take a broader look at what it means to be a professional and what it means to be a professional that works in data in a complex organization.

When we again instituted these Lunch and Learns, we purposefully made them decidedly casual. The topics can have a broad range and be about anything that we think can make our team stronger. This time around we can bring to the table topics that we are not necessarily very knowledgeable about but that we want to lead a discussion around because perhaps we were inspired by a blog post or a podcast. 

**List of Our Lunch and Learn Topics So Far:**
- Leadership Frames
- Storytelling with Data
- Checking the Representative of Samples
- Data Wise Model/Driving Continuous Improvement
- Working From Home and Self-Care

And next week, I'll be leading a discussion around Fairness and Data Science, which was inspired by a talk at rstudio::global by Grant Fleming.

#### Tips for Making Lunch and Learns Work For Your Team

- Don't have Lunch and Learns too often but don't have so infrequently that they lose momentum. Once a month has worked on my team.
- Place reminders on your staff meeting agenda about who is hosting the upcoming Lunch and Learn. People are busy so may forget it's their turn to host.
- Let topics be broad.
- Set expectations that preparing to host the Lunch and Learn should be a low-stress endeavor.
- After several Lunch and Learns, ask what's working and not working to improve the experience. Repeat this step on occasion.

Lunch and Learns have been a really fun part of our remote environment. And I hope we keep it going when we're back in the office. If your team does not already do something like this, I would recommend giving it a try. 

Does your data team have Lunch and Learns or something similar?
