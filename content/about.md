description: Introducing my background
title: About
---

I am a data strategist and programmer. I was introduced to R in 2017 and began coding in R and SQL in 2018, and I love being a part of the R community #RStats. I have over time come to understand how the art of good programming can be essential to effective and efficient data analysis, so I have leaned into continuously learning to be better at it.
