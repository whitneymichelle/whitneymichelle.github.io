description: Introducing my background
title: About
---

I am a data analyst applying software development techniques within a modern data stack. 

I was introduced to R in 2017 and began coding in R and SQL in 2018, and I love being a part of the R community. I have over time come to understand how the art of good programming can be essential to effective and efficient data analysis and operational improvement, so I have leaned into continuously learning to be better at it. Follow me on Twitter [@whitneyondata](https://www.twitter.com/whitneyondata), and see my personal projects on [Github](https://github.com/whitneymichelle).
